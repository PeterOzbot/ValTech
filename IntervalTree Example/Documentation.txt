---Interval tree---

Explanation: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interval-tree/

Tree is used to hold all intervals that not overlap with each other and to check if new one will overlap any existing one.
This tree is simpler and weaker version of KDTree.

The tree is used to hold intervals(ranges, like 2-3). 
Before insert into the tree, we can perform Search with given interval. Search returns any interval that overlaps given one.
