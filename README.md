#### Peak Detection
Algorithm for detecting which point is peak in a given list of points. Idea taken from [Simple Algorithms for Peak Detection in Time-Series - Girish Keshav Palshikar)](http://sites.google.com/site/girishpalshikar/Home/mypublications/SimpleAlgorithmsforPeakDetectioninTimeSeriesACADABAI_2009.pdf).
<br> Sample app generates some curve and detects peaks on it. Demonstration uses [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) library. Detection can be calibrated with few parameters.

#### Rectangle Overlaping

Using custom implementation of [K-D Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) to check if new rectangle does not overlap any existing one.
<br>Sample app generates random rectangle in given 2D space. For each new one checks if it overlaps any previously generated. if it overlpas its not drawn.

#### Web page image capture

Tool to create images of web pages. Tool gets URL and creates image of the page on that URL.
<br>For image capture [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) is used.

#### Async Data & UI Virtualization

Custom collection for data virtualization with support for UI virtualization also. 
<br>New batch (page) of elements is loaded asynchronously.

#### Interval tree 

Implemented data structure Interval Tree for checking if intervals overlap.
<br>Explanation can be found [here](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interval-tree/). 

#### Animating Panel

Two custom WPF panels. One panel animates elements added to it another animates elements on mouse over.
